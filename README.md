# Student-Data-Collection
This repository contains a simple HTML form to collect data from students. The form is designed to be used by Aditya's Classes. The form is created with HTML and includes jQuery to validate the form fields. It also contains a webcam image capturing page along with data table of 1 Lakh People.

Getting Started:

To get started with this project, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine. You can then open the index.html file in your web browser to view the form.

Form Fields:

The form includes the following fields:

Name, Address, Email, Phone Number, Gender.

All fields are required, and the form will not submit unless all fields are filled in.

It will point to the partiular box to fill in the data if you have left any entry empty.

Also I have added command for the unique-email for the every entry in the form.

Validation:

Validation is performed using jQuery. When the form is submitted, the jQuery code checks that all required fields have been filled in. If any fields are missing, an alert message is displayed, and the form is not submitted.

Styling:

The form is styled using CSS. The form elements are centered on the page, and the form itself is contained within a border. The page background is an image that covers the entire background.
